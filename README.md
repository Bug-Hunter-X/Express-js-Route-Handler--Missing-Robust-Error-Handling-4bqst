# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Robust Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling.  The provided `bug.js` file showcases a route that attempts to retrieve a user by ID. However, it lacks proper error handling for invalid input or scenarios where the user is not found.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this issue by implementing more robust error handling that checks for invalid user IDs and provides more informative error responses.
